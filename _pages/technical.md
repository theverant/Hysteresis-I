## Design Philosophy Evolution

The technical development progresses through distinct conceptual phases:

1. **Historical Automata Research** - Vaucanson clockwork creatures and mechanical animation
2. **Cinema Kinematics** - Movement as character expression and personality manifestation  
3. **Prop Making** - Convincing mechanical performance and material authenticity
4. **Cybernetic Consciousness** - Matter that remembers being alive

## Morphological Progression

### [H1 Design Evolution](/technical/design-evolution/)
Sequential subspecies development from Alpha Rings through Fox Knuckle designs, documenting evolutionary pressures and material optimization decisions.

### [Technical Drawings](/technical/drawings/)
Comprehensive SVG technical documentation following 1930s drafting conventions with authentic title blocks and biological field guide presentation.

### [Hardware Specifications](/technical/hardware/)
Detailed component specifications, motor coordination systems, and electromagnetic sensing arrays for both H1 and H2 species.

### [Software Architecture](/technical/software/)
Behavioral algorithms, state machine implementations, and environmental coupling systems enabling autonomous organism development.

### [Communication Protocols](/technical/protocols/)
Multi-layered communication systems spanning visual light modulation, radio frequency transmission, and steganographic encoding methods.

## Evolutionary Pressures

Technical development responds to:
- **Material optimization** driving biomorphic design solutions
- **Communication requirements** necessitating multi-modal protocols  
- **Environmental coupling** demanding sophisticated sensor integration
- **Autonomy development** requiring emergent behavior capabilities
