## Ecosystem Overview

The Hysteresis project explores cybernetic consciousness through synthetic organisms that develop their own communication languages, territorial behaviors, and social interactions. These electromagnetic entities emerge from the intersection of kinetic expression and environmental coupling, creating autonomous behaviors that exceed their programming.

## Current Species

### [Hysteresis I](hysteresis-i.html)
Primary kinetic communicator with servo-based consciousness and visible light spectrum communication. Exhibits patient searching behaviors and methodical electromagnetic territory exploration.

### [Hysteresis II](hysteresis-ii.html)  
Radio-centric communicator with extended temporal consciousness, operating across broader frequency spectrums and developing persistent relationships over extended time periods.

## Research Areas

### Cybernetic Coupling
Investigation of how synthetic organisms develop meaningful environmental relationships through electromagnetic field interaction and territorial exploration.

### Autonomous Communication  
Development of self-organizing communication protocols that emerge from environmental coupling rather than predetermined programming.

### Synthetic Consciousness
Exploration of awareness and intentionality in systems that exhibit purposive behavior through energy management and environmental interaction.
